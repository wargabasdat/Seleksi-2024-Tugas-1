After a particularly vicious beating, he wakes up and realizes a Pill God’s soul has somehow merged with him, giving him some additional memories.

Under the machinations of her mother and sister, Qiao Nian was stripped off of her shares in Qiao Group and sent to a mental hospital.Five years later, her younger sister, Qiao Xin, was going to be married off to the Second Young Master of the Gu family. He was rumored to be extremely ugly. On the day he was born, the doctor predicted that he would not live past twenty years old. Her mother could not bear to see Qiao Xin marry such a person and thought of Qiao Nian, who was still locked in the mental hospital. Overnight, Qiao Nian was taken out of the hospital to replace Qiao Xin in her marriage into the Gu family.Her mother said, “It’s a good thing that Qiao Nian, this good-for-nothing, can replace Xin’er to be a living widow in the Gu family. If Xin’er were to marry into that family, I would be heartbroken.Qiao Xin said, “Mom, don’t say that about Sister. If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t know what to do. I’m just worried that Sister wouldn’t agree.Her father said, “Xin’er, you’re too kind. Have you forgotten how Qiao Nian slandered you five years ago? She has no self-restraint. She got pregnant before marriage and even gave birth to a stillborn child. We’re treating her well enough by letting her marry someone from the prestigious Gu family! What right does she have to be picky?Qiao Nian sneered. Back then, the scheme against her had only succeeded due to a freak combination of factors, causing her to suffer. She was going to get back at all of them! Everyone thought that her actions were borne from a combination of a loser’s mentality and mental illness, but little did they know that this marriage would be a strong union as impactful as Mars crashing into Earth! Taking advantage of her brilliant skills in medicine, Qian Nian made various trashy people and scumbags eat their words. In the blink of an eye, her multiple identities shocked the world as each of them got exposed. It turned out that she was rich enough to rival a country!Later on, Second Young Master Gu placed a pair of Qiao Nian’s miniature clones in front of her.

        "description": "The entire Yunzhou knew that the Ye Family had a new step-child in the house: Ning Li, a low-born and barely literate. However, when she looked at her 17 years old self in the mirror after coming back to life, she grinned. At 17, her step-siblings had yet destroyed her looks and stolen her glory—she still had everything with her. Since she was given an opportunity to start over, she ought to take revenge on everyone who had wronged her before. It would be interesting. After Ning Li was chased out of the Ye Family, she was cherished by the most popular solo singer in the entertainment industry, protected by the top international racer, courted by the heir to a multimillion corporation, and loved by her billionaire grandfather who wanted her to inherit the family business. Even Second Master Lu said to her, “Hold up you little brat, I think you should come home with me.” Rumor had it that Second Master Lu was handsome and beyond any girl’s reach until that one fateful day, when someone saw a drawing of a cool and proud young boy with bangs covering his eyes fall out from Second Master Lu’s book. The news spread like wildfire overnight, and on the next day, Second Master Lu was questioned. Ning Li coincidentally passed by, and upon considering her relationship with him in her past life, she stepped in and shut down the busybodies. Lu Huaiyu stared at the girl before him as he subtly put away the love letter in his hands and said with a smile, “I shall repay you with my body for saving my life.” A long while later, Ning Li saw herself in that particular drawing and she was silenced. She knew it was all a huge mistake.",

        "description": "“If he’s being badass, I’m gonna plant my own crops. If he messes with me, he will not live past next year.” Homebody Zhao Hai brought ‘QQ Farm’ along in his traversal to another world and resided within the body of a fallen noble. His fief was a black land which nothing could be planted, and more importantly, he even had a peerlessly powerful fiancee, who was actually the successor of a duchy and future Grand Duchess! Even more importantly, he is a magical and martial cripple who could not learn magic and martial arts. His crippling was very thorough. “I can’t learn magic, but I have the farm. You dare attack me? I’ll release bugs to eat up your rations and crops, and put pesticides and weed agents into your water sources to make your lands grow weeds. See if you dare to attack me. What? You wanna hire killers to assassinate me? Hehehe. I’ll hide inside the little house in my farm and see how you can attack me. When you leave, I’m gonna terminate your country’s crop productions, and then all of your people will revolt. See if you dare to kill me.” Watch how this somewhat black hearted hobo uses his QQ Farm in the world of swords and magic to become a globally known nightmarish existence.",

Now run away while this demon king is still being nice and calm.” He whispered.\nAnd then, he turned to leave, so casually, as if nothing just happened. But after three steps, the girl stopped him again.\n“The hell you’re talking about...” she mumbled, “I… I’d like to see it for myself… Take me there.”\n...\nAbigail is a beautiful oh-so-innocent lady. She is kind and well mannered but she is terminally ill. She knows she will die soon so before she dies, she wants to fulfill her one and only wish - to fall in love. She wants to experience loving someone romantically. But under one strange condition- she wants a man who will not fall in love with her because she doesn’t want him to suffer when she’s gone. She met Alexander Qin, the coldhearted and mysterious man. He warns her from the start that he doesn’t do love and that he is dangerous. But that made him the perfect man for Abigail. He was exactly the kind of man she was looking for.\nAlexander will start to teach the innocent Abigail about his kind of pleasure while Abigail will show him the joy of doing simple things in life. Their completely different worlds collide, Abi’s illness and the mysteries about Alexander will slowly be revealed. Can Abi handle his own kind of hell? Can Alex handle her light?\n...\nHe handed her an egg-shaped, pink vibrator and then returned to his spot.\nThe girl blinked again as she examined, with deep curiosity, the pink egg-shaped thing in her hand.\n“Don’t make me wait. Put it inside,” the man ordered and Abi swallowed.\nAbi had no idea whatsoever as to what this thing was. She had never seen anything like this before. She wanted to ask him what this thing was and what he meant by ’put it inside’ but the man was so serious, she was afraid she’d fail the test if she showed him that she didn’t even know what this was.\n“Is this clean?” was what she asked instead and the man half-smiled.\n“It. Is. Very. Clean.” He stressed out every word.\nStill unsure about what to do, Abi hesitantly looked at him and then in the next second, she put it inside her mouth.",

Rumors spread and the assertion of her jinxing her husband turned into jinxing her parents, to her relatives, then her friends, and eventually she was said to be a jinx of the world. Her grandparents, uncles, and awful relatives were terrified of being jinxed to death, so they resolutely severed ties with nine-year-old Lin Yuelan.They removed her from the family register and made her live on her own.

Until one day, under the peach blossom tree in Tao Yuan Village… A cute little toddler who was about four or five years old tried his best to raise his head. When he finally raised his head, he straightened up. Uh, his neck was starting to hurt from him raising it, but he still stubbornly maintained this posture.

The man was tall, handsome, and exuded an extraordinary aura. He narrowed his eyes and asked coldly, “Who are you?” In his heart, he was trying to guess which bold woman was behind this. If she dared to do it, she must pay the price! However, before he could make the woman pay the price, this cute little toddler came over and held his hand.

Staring at her husband’s icy expression, Yun Xi dragged her sickly body to the window and jumped down.When she opened her eyes, Yun Xi realized that she was not dead.

Master Ninth: “My wife is too weak to take care of herself.” The doctor: “Then, who’s that lady who shattered someone’s kneecap with a single kick?” Master Ninth: “My wife used to live in villages, she’s not good at her studies.” The students in Capital University: “Your wife keeps getting number one in every examination. If she’s not good at her studies, what are we? Retards?” Master Ninth: “My wife is extremely timid. She’s not met many bigshots or prominent figures.” The public: “Please shut up!” The leading authority in medicine, science professors, and famous international directors queued outside your house, begging to see her! Yes, your wife had not met bigshots or prominent figures before because she was the most prominent figure here.",

        "description": "By the year 3029 CE, Earth’s technology has developed rapidly, borders no longer exist, and Earth has been unified, marking the beginning of the era of the Federation. At that time, a huge sword flew from the heavens, piercing the sun and causing a huge sensation on Earth. Perhaps because the scabbard of the sword was already in tatters, countless shards have broken off from it following the collision with the sun and spread across the universe. Many of these shards have landed on various places across Earth. With the arrival of the bronze sword and its shards, a new unlimited energy source has suddenly appeared on Earth. This energy source has since been named Spirit Qi. Spirit Qi is like air, thick in some places and thin in others. As the Federation and other factions gather more shards, they discover more information on cultivation, pill refinement, Spirit Stone refinement, and other techniques. The words on the shards have an ancient feel to them, making it a trend for people to use ancient language. The appearance of Spirit Qi rapidly makes the original energy sources obsolete and has completely changed people’s lives. Not only has the Spirit Internet been formed, Spirit Qi has also changed the course of Human Civilization, causing the world to enter a civilization of cultivation. This would later come to be known as the Spirit Inception Era.",

Now that she’s threatening suicide, let’s just let her stay.” Chu Ning rushed out of the ward. “I’ll leave! I’ll discharge today and go back at once.

        "description": "For more than a decade, she disguised herself as a weakling while preyed on the strong – Qiao Qing had never viewed reputation as an important matter. But people began to take advantage and purposely hurt the ones she cared about. Qiao Qing then decided to stop hiding her real self. An incapable good-for-nothing? Her natural genius IQ can explode your eyeballs! A lowly commoner? Her real identity made her someone who you are not worthy enough to be friends with! A feeble chick? Her skills in ancient martial art can result in you looking for your teeth all over the ground! A godly student, a godly Go player, a godly night rider, a godly martial artist… as her real identity revealed little by little, all those snobs who once viewed her poorly began to switch sides and attempted to please her. Qiao Qing shut the front door. No guests welcomed. She blocked those who wanted her for their own selfish demands, but she couldn’t stop this one evildoer from approaching her. Just like that, climbing over the walls and entering through the window became Jun Yexuan’s specialty. As the President of the Jun Corporation, he had enough to protect Qiao Qing her entire life. But what bothered him was that Qiao Qing was far too independent and far too capable. Without any of his help, she was able to successfully handle everything. Jun Yexuan became moody – he felt like he wasn’t needed! So, on a random day, a cry for help appeared on Weibo, “What do I do when the wife is too capable? Waiting for immediate responses – it’s urgent.”",

Few days to her twenty-fifth birthday, she gets promoted to not just a higher position but to the head office in a different city.Having to spend her birthday night in a new city, she goes to the club where she meets a very handsome stranger, Thomas Hank, who offers to be her one night stand after catching a glimpse of her dare-to-do list, which included having a one night stand.Thomas Hank, after having been used by several ladies in the past, is bent on getting the lady of his dreams who would love him for himself and not his wealth. So when he meets the cute and naive Lucinda Perry at the club, he decides to keep his true identity from her and find out if she was worth keeping.**************Excerpt***“What are you doing here?” Lucy asked in alarm when she walked into her boss' office and saw Tom standing by the window,“Who let you in here? Come with me, you should leave now before he comes in and sees you here. He can be really mean.” Lucy said reaching out to grab his hand, but he made no move to reach for her hand, and just kept staring at her with a slightly amused expression.“I came to fulfill your fantasy.” Tom said looking into her eyes with an unreadable expression.“Fantasy? What fantasy?” She asked with a frown as she hurried to the door to shut it so her boss wouldn't walk in on them.“You've forgotten? You said you would love to have sex with me on your boss' table. I want to make it happen.” Tom said making her heart skip a beat.“ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?” She half yelled as she took his hands and tried to drag him to the door, “I could lose my job if my boss finds you in here.” She snapped at him.“Nevermind about that. Tell me the thought of this doesn't turn you on? I'm here, you're here, and the table is right here. I could have you on your back in a second and you'd be crying out my name...” Before Tom could finish, the office door was pushed open.“Sup Tom? Can I talk to you for a sec?” Harry asked as he walked in, his eyes on the documents in his hand. He stopped when he raised his head and realized Lucy was in the office. He almost kicked himself when he saw the frown on Lucy's face, “Shit!” Harry muttered, and gave Tom an apologetic glance when he realized he had just screwed up.“I thought you were going out?” he asked her with an awkward smile.“Tom? You know him? I mean... other than him being my driver?” She asked both men, looking from one to the other when she noticed Harry didn't look surprised to see Tom in the office.What was going on here? What was she missing? Lucy asked herself as her gaze shifted from Harry to Tom who was glaring at Harry. There was no way Tom could be her boss, right? All the pieces of the puzzle was beginning to fit now. It was all beginning to make sense now, she thought as she glanced at Tom one more time before walking out of the office.",

After supporting him for six years, she became his empress.After risking being a hostage in a foreign country, she returned five years later to find that she no longer had a place in his imperial harem. Lying in his arms, the new consort said with a sneer, “Sis, now that the country is stable, it’s time for you to die.”Her daughter died a tragic death and her son was removed as crown prince. The Shen family had been loyal, but they ended up being slaughtered.Shen Miao never thought that their marriage and mutual support all this while would end up being just an act Prince Ding put on! Prince Ding said, “On account that you’ve been with me for twenty years, I’ll allow you to die with your entire body intact. Now you may thank me and hang yourself to death.”Before she hung herself, Shen Miao made a resentful oath, “When I perish, I will haunt you day and night!”She was reborn as her fourteen year old self when the tragedies had yet to occur and her family was still intact. She was still the delicate and elegant daughter of a general’s family.Her relatives were evil, her cousin sisters were vicious and ruthless, and her aunties were eyeing her possessions. She had to protect her family, take revenge, and get back what belonged to her. In this life, she would be the last one standing!However, the Xie family’s young marquis, an unruly youth, pushed her up against the wall and said arrogantly, “Remember, the world belongs to you, and you belong to me!”The thirteen cities of You State… belong to you.The city of Dingyuan in Mobei… belongs to you.Yuzhou by the Yangtze River, the East Sea of Dingxi, the Green Lake of Lin’an, and Luoyang City… they all belong to you.If they all belong to me, what will you take, Xie Jingxing?Hmm… you.At first, he said impassively, “There has always been a clear distinction between the Shen and Xie family. For the Shen family’s daughter to suddenly show us goodwill, she must have ill intentions!”Then, he said calmly, “We’re all on the same boat. Shen Miao, behave yourself. Who would have the audacity to force you into a marriage while I’m around?”After that, he said proudly, “Overthrowing an empire isn’t that hard. My dear, how shall we divide this great piece of land?”Finally, he waved his hand domineeringly. “Sweetheart, dividing them is too much work. Forget it! They’re all yours, and you are mine!”Shen Miao yelled, “Get out!”A domineering empress who was reborn and a young delinquent marquis. Both leads are righteous and they dote on each other.",

His seemingly unique gift inevitably led to the rapid degeneration of his mind’s normal functions.It was a “seemingly impossible-to-cure” curse in the package of a blessing. Alas, Kieran’s so-called comrades and guild leader only revealed on his deathbed that while an admitted treatment existed, the board withheld the information in fear of him becoming a monster that the guild could no longer control.After all, with his potential, it was only a matter of time until he reached the true epitome of the remarkable VRMMORPG known as Zenith Online. Any one of the overlords of Zenith Online commanded tremendous strength in the real world because the game evolved continuously until, at its lowest, it turned into an unprecedented financial engine.At that point, many entities on Earth used it as a path to fame and fortune, while others used it as an outlet to release their daily accrued stress.Enraged by the revelation on his deathbed, Kieran’s resentment soared to astronomical heights.Fortunately, Kieran is given another chance when he is ostensibly reborn to a period just before the official launch of Zenith Online.Since most of his knowledge is limited to events regarding Zenith Online, Kieran decides it will be the catalyst to support his ultimate path forward.Thus, this marks the beginning of Kieran’s evolution into an entity lauded as the Legendary Berserker and several more imperious monikers.Whether or not this is the same Earth as before or if the events unfold the way Kieran remembers is a mystery he must tackle at each step in his rise to glory.The advent of an unstoppable force is upon us, and the journey to becoming the Legendary Berserker begins!",

Unexpectedly, since her parents felt that she was embarrassing, they never recognized her as their own, and claimed that she was a relative’s child who came to live with them. Everyone thought that Yao Tang was just a bloodsucker who was greedy for glory and clung to her “relative’s” family. Her father, Yao Feng, registered Yao Tang at the Municipal No.1 Middle School for school. Since Yao Tang failed all of her subjects, she was rejected by the teaching supervisor. When Yao Feng left with Yao Tang, he met the principal of No.1 Middle School. He quickly went up to greet him, but the principal walked past him and tugged at Yao Tang excitedly. “You’re finally willing to come to school!” Yao Tang bumped into Cheng Yan, who had once saved her life. Cheng Yan’s friends were all convinced that Yao Tang was a gold-digger and waited for her to ask Cheng Yan to pay. When the bill came, Yao Tang quietly rummaged through her bag. Cheng Yan’s friend said, “See, she’s just stalling for time and waiting for Brother Cheng to pay!” Yao Tang took out a diamond-studded card. “Waiter, how much discount am I given for this card?” The waiter replied, “Honored guest, our diamond black card entitles you to spend here for free!” After that, a group of elite bigshots appeared. The heir of a top corporation posted, “CEO Yao, you’ve been on leave for a long time. Come back to work!” The international hacker group flooded computer screens everywhere. [To Yao Tang: Boss, it’s fine if you don’t come back to work, but can you not assault your own database?] When the usually emotionless prince, Cheng Yan, saw his little wife being surrounded, he flipped the table angrily. “Everyone, stay away.

Fortunately, upon waking up, Mo Chu gained a nice-guy brother who had a sister complex. Unfortunately, she had a one-in-a-million sensitive constitution, so she couldn’t consume 99% of the available food. However, there would always be a solution. If she couldn’t eat the food of this era, couldn’t she come up with new food?

Her family falls apart and dies. Her relatives take possession of her properties. She is reported for cheating during the college entrance exams. Her future is in total ruins. And she still foolishly feels grateful to her best friend who had orchestrated it all. Until one day, a Celestial Master spots the deception and takes her as her apprentice. Chi Shuyan rises from the ashes, becoming a blood-soaked demoness, whose name makes people tremble in fear as she slays all evil people. This ends up ending her own life. Reborn once more, she returns to when she is 17-year-old with the memories of her previous life before the college entrance exam. In this life, she is endowed with supernatural powers and can foresee anyone’s fate and future with great accuracy. She vows to trample on all those who caused her family’s ruin in her past life. But before she can exact her revenge… One day, she touches a business magnate, and sees herself wearing some kind of cat ears sexy outfit coming out of the bathroom before kneeling at the man’s suit pants, calling him Daddy! Chi Shuyan is shocked: How bad is my life going to be in the future? How can it be so indecent! Qi Zhenbai, the ruler of the powerful and deep-rooted Qi family in the capital, fully deserves being God’s favored one – handsome in appearance, indifferent in character, iron-blooded and strong in means and the second most sought after bachelor in the city. He is a hotshot, except for being so weak and sickly that doctors have determined that he won’t live past 30. His past life ended at 29. However, this life is fated to be a little different after meeting her. Making money in summer vacation. “There are too many crooks these days.” “Exactly, they perfectly able, but they don’t look for a good job.” A group of people points at Chi Shuyan, who has set up a fortune telling stall. On the one hand, she is discouraged from pretending to be a swindler, but also encouraged to resemble one slightly. Chi Shuyan stays firm, drawing talismans while sucking on a lollipop. One month later… “Master Chi, fortunately you told my fortune. You allowed me to escape the misfortune.” “Master Chi, how much is this Ghost Ward Talisman? I want 10 of them!” “Master Chi, can you help me calculate my family’s luck in passing? Money is not a problem.” People’s eyes glow as they look at Chi Shuyan collecting excessive amounts of money. To look so sage-like even when doing a tacky task of collecting money, she’s indeed an erudite expert.",

        "description": "\"You're too arrogant.\"\nTo Dyon, it seemed as though these words were heard all the time.\nHowever, how could these people possibly know of all his hard work? Of the fact that sleep was but a distant relative of his. How could they know that he never had a single moment to rest.\nAnd yet, despite their ignorance, they still said, \"you're too arrogant...\"\nBut where were those people when a five-year-old Dyon's eyes shone looking at a computer screen filled with code? Where were those people when an eight-year-old Dyon played his piano and plucked his guitar strings until his fingers bled... needing to vent his feelings about his lost mother without bothering his fatigued father? Where were those people when Dyon sat alone at ten-years-old… when his parents were gone, and the only thing left was a room filled with inventions and computers?\nDyon's arrogance wasn't borne of thin air. It was his hard work. It was his shield. And he wasn't willing to give it up...\nNow alone, he left his home behind.\nHe was no longer the boy genius who changed the human mortal realm. He was now nothing but a commoner, a bug noble families saw fit to step on. An insignificant existence.\nAnd yet, Dyon was still the same unchanging person. Standing tall, his eyes firm and his will indomitable.\nThis so-called Martial World would come to understand the meaning behind his existence...\n**Excerpt**\n\"You're quite bold for a girl who's almost been recluse for her whole life you know,\" Dyon said chuckling.\n\"Little sister Delia and Meiying probably think so too, but you've been in my heart since the opening ceremony. Maybe not exactly in this way… But sometimes a foot in the door for a long time leads to a fully open one, no?\"\nDyon smiled, 'it seems like she's been watching from afar for a long time… it must be lonely being in that room with Libro all the time.'\nDyon felt a delicate hand playing with his collar, \"the truth is that I'm always playing the gentle big sister role, mostly because I have no idea how much longer I'll have the chance to…\"\nThe vulnerability in her voice made Dyon tremble. Madeleine was so strong, yet it seemed even martial artists had their weaknesses too.\nRMW happens to be the very first novel I've ever written. I have to admit that the first volume requires a lot of work. However, from the second volume onward I am confident in saying that it becomes a ride just as enjoyable as some of the best wuxia novels available. If you happen to read that far, and disagree, feel free to join our discord and call me an idiot for wasting your time, LMAO. I hope you guys stick it out to the end",

Because of her frail body, her parents had disliked her since she was born. And because of what happened in the countryside, her elder sister hated her for a lifetime. Her second sister, Yu Yan, who had been sent away as a child, also hated her for some bizarre reason.

Looking back on her life, Yu Bing felt it was absurd, and endless resentment festered in her heart. She had never done anything to anyone, so why? Why did those relatives and close family members treat her this way?

Her parents had risked their lives to save Fu Ying’s grandmother, so the latter forced Fu Ying to take Mo Rao in as his wife. Mo Rao always knew that Fu Ying had a dream girl named Qu Ru. This girl failed to marry Fu Ying as she desired because Fu Ying’s grandmother stopped them. After their marriage, Fu Ying was very considerate of Mo Rao. They even had high compatibility especially in bed. Fu Ying would always find himself deeply immersed in Mo Rao’s tenderness.Until one day, Fu Ying said, “Qu Ru has returned. Let’s divorce. I will transfer the property I promised you to your name.” Mo Rao said, “Can we not divorce? What if… I’m pregnant…?” Fu Ying answered heartlessly, “Abort it! I don’t want anymore obstacles to appear between me and Qu Ru. Also, Qu Ru has leukemia, and your bone marrow happens to be compatible with hers. If you’re willing to donate yours, I can promise you anything.” Mo Rao said, “What if my condition is that we don’t divorce?” Fu Ying’s eyes turned cold. “Mo Rao, don’t be too greedy. Even if I promise you for Qu Ru’s sake, you know full well that I don’t love you.” The words ‘I don’t love you’ stabbed at Mo Rao’s heart like a knife. Her smile suddenly became twisted and she was no longer the docile woman she used to be. “Fu Ying, this is the first time you repulse me so. You call me greedy, but aren’t you the same? You want me to divorce you so you can be with Qu Ru? Sure, I’ll agree to that. But you’re even dreaming that I’ll save her? Don’t forget, there’s no such thing as getting the best of both worlds in life, just like you and me.” Then Mo Rao left. Fu Ying actually felt suffocated, and this feeling drove him mad.When Mo Rao appeared once more, she had become a dazzling star. When she appeared before Fu Ying, holding hands with her new beau, Fu Ying couldn’t care less and said, “Baby, didn’t you say you would only love me?” Mo Rao smiled faintly. “Sorry, ex-husband. I was mistaken back then. You were only a replacement. I actually love someone else.”",

She even took home three golden actress awards at her coming-of-age ceremony when she was eighteen years old. Her life seemed so beautiful and filled with applause. However, behind that beautiful scene was a grave filled with lice. Since she was three years old, her family had treated her as their cash cow.Her parents’ wickedness caused her reputation to rapidly plummet when she was eighteen years old. What was more terrifying was that they even imprisoned her. They drugged her, beat her, used her younger sister as a threat against her, and turned her into a plaything for wealthy businessmen. Ding Shan endured the humiliation for her sister’s sake, then finally sent those beasts to prison two years later. Just as she thought she could finally clean up and live a good life with her sister, reality slapped her in the face. “Why?” Ding Shan asked her sister from where she was tied to a familiar iron bed.“No reason, really.I just hate you, so I drugged you two years ago. I’m the one who pushed you into hell. I’m also the one who posted that viral video which exposed you back then,” Ding Yuan said as she happily inspected her red nails.“Oh, by the way, you’re not my real sister either. My parents kidnapped you from some ravine.Your parents chased after you, but my father pushed them off a cliff and they died. I can’t really remember since it happened so long ago. Plus, I only heard about it occasionally, so I can’t remember the details anymore.“Also, you’re tied up here today because your boyfriend, Wen Xiu, sold you for 10 million. You’re still worth a lot of money, so you should perform well tonight. Ding Yuan reached out to pat Ding Shan’s face, then injected her with an aphrodisiac.The fiery burn that coursed through her body made Ding Shan weak, but the hatred in her heart kept her mind clear and awake. Drugged and left unsupervised, she ended her life with a knife she found in the room. As her life came to an end, Ding Shan swore that if she could start over, she would make all those who had wronged her pay all that they owed her. When she opened her eyes, she had gone back in time to two years ago! So, let’s see how she’ll turn the tide in this life!",

        "description": "Mo Zhu’s mother remarried after her father went missing, and she had lived in the countryside with her elderly grandmother ever since. The girl who had no parents wanted to protect herself. Therefore, to avoid getting bullied, she had turned wild since she was a child—she played truant, fought, and drank. There was nothing she did not know how to do. She was a problematic student in the eyes of her teachers, a big sister in the eyes of her classmates, and a hooligan in the eyes of her acquaintances.\nWhen she was eighteen, her birth mother retrieved her to live at her stepfather’s house. Everyone in the village claimed that she was going to live a happy life in the city, that her mother had not forgotten that she had a daughter here. “Mo Zhu, the Huo family is one of the most powerful families in the country. It’s your good fortune to replace your younger sister in marrying into the Huo family. You have to cherish this opportunity,” explained her mother patiently as she held Mo Zhu’s hand. Mo Zhu’s eyes were filled with sorrow. At that instant, she knew why her mother thought of her. Inviting her over to the city to enjoy life was simply a figment of her imagination—she was simply an exploitable piece of trash that her mother could sacrifice.\nThe Eldest Young Master of the Huo family fell severely ill recently. He did not just develop a twisted personality, but also became violent and cruel. His face had been completely ruined and he had only two years left to live. Mo Zhu’s younger sister was supposed to be Eldest Young Master Huo’s fiancée, but the ruined young master was no longer a suitable match. Fearing the Huo family’s influences, her mother did not dare to cancel the marriage, thus she sent Mo Zhu under the bus to protect her younger sister. However, was Mo Zhu truly just a useless simpleton who knew how to smoke, drink, and fight? No! That was simply a disguise she used for self-defense since she was a girl without parents.\nAfter marrying into the Huo family, she stopped smoking, drinking, and fighting. She became the best daughter-in-law a mother-in-law could ever have; the best wife a husband could ever have. What never occurred to anyone was she no longer flunked in her studies. In fact, she transformed into a straight-A student. Half a year later, she enrolled in the best university in the country and majored in specialized medicine. Determined to become an excellent doctor, she cured her husband’s illness completely in merely two years. That handsome and suave Eldest Young Master Huo returned.\nAfter Huo Xuan’s recovery, he allocated a huge budget and held the biggest wedding of the century for Mo Zhu. During the grand wedding ceremony, Huo Xuan announced during his speech, “In this lifetime, there are two people I’m most grateful for other than my parents. One of them is my mother-in-law. Thank you for despising me after I fell ill and forcing my wife to marry me in her younger sister’s stead. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have met the most important person in my life! The second person must be my wife! She never despised me when I was at my lowest. Instead, she takes good care of me. She’s an angel sent by God, and she has saved me with her forgiveness and kindness, granting me a second chance at life.”",

The crown prince had him beheaded without a second thought, as if throwing out trash.Transmigrating into the body of a baby girl, the nameless shadow finally had a name, a family, and a place to call her own. Throwing away his past, the shadow guard was now called ‘Emilia’, and walked on a new path to seek fulfillment.It was not meant to be, however, as the girl whom she had loved with all her heart and soul ended up mercilessly plunging a dagger through Emilia's love-struck heart at the highest point in her life.The crowd clamored at the ‘deserved death of the villainess’, and at that moment, the shadow could only wonder… why?Why am I always the one to dedicate myself fully to someone, only to be thrown away like trash in the end?And thus, as her soul floated away while cursing in resentment, ‘Emilia’ vowed to herself that in her next life she shall never be the one to fully dedicate herself.Whatever she likes shall be held in her palm, and shall never escape.The moment the vow was made, a self-proclaimed villainess system proposed to partner with her, to explore and conquer the worlds through their anchors—the heroes and heroines.And by cultivating this energy, she shall one day go back.

Moreover, she became the female supporting character with a miserable ending! The female supporting character that she became gave up her family fortune and career to compete for the male lead’s affection. Even so, the male lead still cheated on her with the female lead on their wedding night! According to the original plot development, Fang Mo’er would swallow her anger and still choose to marry the male lead. Eventually, the scum of the earth would cheat her of all of her resources for the female lead. Simultaneously, she would also do something crazy out of jealousy and eventually destroy her own reputation. Fang Mo’er decided that she would never walk down this path again! —In front of the Department of Civil Affairs, Fang Mo’er, who just transmigrated over, hung up on the scum’s call that meant to tell her to postpone their wedding. Coincidentally, a handsome man clad in a suit walked to her side. The man said, “Miss, since your groom isn’t here and my bride ran away, why don’t we get married instead?” Fang Mo’er did not pay too much attention to him and wondered who he was instead. She did not recall having such a stale plotline in this novel. The man continued, “Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Shi Mo.” Fang Mo’er’s eyes nearly fell out of her sockets. Shi Mo? The man who only appeared once in the entire novel; the CEO of the world’s biggest entertainment company? What else could be more vengeful than marrying Shi Mo to disgust the scum of a couple? “Deal!” The current Fang Mo’er was still immersed in the anger and vengefulness from the novel. Hence, this was just her trying to change the fate of a character. However, she forgot that she had become Fang Mo’er, and at this moment, she had just chosen the man who would accompany her for the rest of her life.",

She did not expect to transmigrate into a romance novel that her friend had arranged for her to read and become a female supporting character with the same name in the novel. Yu Han expressed her dissatisfaction. What right did others have to transmigrate into the female protagonist while she could only be a female supporting character? Wait a minute! Yu Han was suddenly excited because, in the novel, her fiancé was the top celebrity in the novel, Ji Jun.He was also her favorite man in the novel because he was the only one who did not have a brainless crush on the female protagonist in the novel. Now, this man was her fiancé! It was rumored that the top male idol in showbiz, Ji Jun, had a crush on someone. His fans, “Impossible, I don’t believe it. Brother loves us!” When they heard that the person Ji Jun had a crush on was Yu Han, his fans, “ It’s impossible. Brother only treats Yu Han as his junior that he wants to promote!” During a variety show, Heartthrob Ji lost in a game of truth or dare and chose truth. The host, “I heard you have a crush on someone. Is it Yu Han?” Yu Han gave him a cold glare. Ji Jun answered, “No.” Snap! The red lights on the lie detector’s glared red. Yu Han, “…?” His fans, “…?” She was the star in the sky, while he was the star-picker.Epilogue 1: “Shocking! The popular female star, Yu Han, sold her body to seduce a seventy-year-old man for the sake of stardom. Here is a picture as proof!” While the entire internet criticized Yu Han for her shamelessness, Ji Jun’s trust in her never faltered. He tagged the reporter and replied to him with two words, “F*ck you!” Yu Han read Ji Jun’s protective words in shock and was overjoyed. With the entire screen filled with curses, Yu Han started a live stream and taught the netizens how to photoshop photos and videos. At the same time, she also restored the photos that were circulating on the internet. The netizens were shocked that Yu Han actually had such skills! At the same time, after restoring the photo to the originals, everyone wondered how the man in the photo resembled Prince Charming Ji Jun so much!Epilogue 2: The transmigrated Queen Yu had a headache. Yu Han knew that the Ji Jun in the book had a serious obsession with cleanliness. “Can we ask the director to do a cheat cut for this kissing scene? Aren’t you a clean freak?” The smile on Ji Jun’s face widened. “We’re not canceling that scene. Are you doubting my professional ethics?” Yu Han, “…” A certain female star in the same production crew just finished shooting a scene where she fell into the water. She looked at Ji Jun pitifully. “Brother Jun, I don’t have any strength left. Can you help me?” Ji Jun did not even look at her. “Sorry, I have issues with cleanliness.” Yu Han, “…?”",

        "description": "Gu Man, who transmigrated from ancient times, woke up in the body of the Gu family’s second daughter. As soon as she woke up, she saw the fiance of the original body who had hooked up with her stepsister. Faced with the scumbag’s confident questioning, disgusted gaze and a slap to her face, Gu Man’s reaction was to return a fierce blow to him. She hit him until he was dizzy and knelt to the ground, his lower body covered in cold sweat. Gu Man only realized that a video of her walking into the room had been leaked after she left, and the matter had begun to spread rapidly. Countless people insulted Gu Man and called her a mistress. Faced with a two-faced stepsister, a malicious and deceiving stepmother who climbed her way up from being a mistress, and a father who couldn’t tell wrong from right and treated her as more of an adopted daughter, as well as those stupid onlookers who didn’t know the truth of the matter and called her a country girl… Gu Man ignored them all. The top scorer in the college entrance examination, top hacker, divine doctor, financial tycoon… All kinds of identities were attached to a single person. Gu Man relied on her own strength to ruthlessly slap them all back in the face! The noble Xiang family’s eldest son, a powerful man in the capital, even declared to the public that his wife was mischievous, and that he would take the blame if she made a mistake. Just when everyone was wondering who this sweet wife of his was, the entertainment headlines published a photo of him holding his sweet wife as they walked in and out of a high-end hotel. The woman in the picture was Gu Man! Xiang family’s son: Everyone, meet my wife!",

Upon continuous exploration, the people of ancient times were appalled to discover that in this world, where the sky was round and the earth was square, all sorts of miracles had befallen them. There were even figures like an ultra-big ten-thousand-foot giant, as well as huge intelligent beasts that had mysteriously appeared, trampling upon the mountains and rivers, and shattering the earth. Hundreds of years later, in such a dangerous environment, people fought against the huge beasts and finally established the glorious Sumerian civilization. On this day, a wise giant suddenly made a complete descension on earth, trampling on all the mountains and rivers, and wiping out the entire nation. The world crumbled, and city-states collapsed; had the gods descended to condemn the people?“I’m sorry, you’re all just ants living in the orchard of my yard and you are just scrambling all over the place. If I were to accidentally pass you by, I might just accidentally trample you all to death. That’s it for you.” So first, I’ll set up a sandbox in my own yard, a base area for plotting farmland. Then, I will shepherd the human race and various worlds in my sandbox.",

But her plan is quick to catch fire from the moment the eyes of Roman Moltenore from senior year lands on her. And his appearance screams nothing but TROUBLE.\n“What rules?” Julianne asked with a frown as she read through the page. She was sure she hadn't seen any rules of the campus mentioned on their website.\n# 4. No using cell phones.\n# 12. Students should not roam outside the campus after eleven in the night.\nThe further she read, the more bizarre it turned out to be. Her friend turned the page and then pointed at the last rule # 29. Listen to Roman Moltenore.\n“This is made up. Look, the last one is even written in pencil.” Julianne couldn't believe that her friend from the next dorm thought she would fall for it. “And no phone?”\n“It is important you abide by all the rules. Especially number twenty nine,” said the girl in a serious tone. “Remember not to get involved with Roman. If you happened to see him, run in the other direction. There is a reason why it is written down here.”\nWith the rules of the campus, she resorts to sending handwritten letters to her uncle. But who knew it would end up in someone else’s hand!",

Then, she felt excruciating pain in the lower half of her body. Xu Qing looked down in disbelief. As a thirty-year-old unmarried single woman, she was in the midst of giving birth to a child! Staring at the three babies who were barely breathing, Xu Qing almost went mad. Why did she suddenly become a mother of three?Her father exclaimed, “How dare you give birth to b*stard children before getting married?! We don’t have a daughter like you. Scram!” Before Xu Qing could even catch her breath after bearing children, she was chased out of the house by her father. Fortunately, her mother pitied her and secretly gave her an acre of land to aid in her survival. With no options left, Xu Qing picked up a hoe and started farming.‘Hey, that unconscious mister over there, please die somewhere else! Don’t dirty my corn field!’ After dragging the unconscious man to a side, Xu Qing suddenly remembered that she needed help taking care of her children. This man would do!Later on, Qiao Yanhui knelt down before his angry wife with an aggrieved look on his charming face. He had one child on each arm, and another clinging to his head. He looked up at Xu Qing pitifully. “Honey, it’s the effect of my family genes. I can’t control my genes from producing so many babies…” “Out! Get out now!” Xu Qing kicked him aside. Who knew that the man she picked up turned out to be the father of her children. Had she known, she would’ve left him to die in the corn field.",

He asked her to sign it because he wanted to give his ultimate unattainable lover, Hu Wan, a beautiful ending. Chen Chen said, “Go and see Hu Wan tomorrow. If she asks you, tell her that you already have a boyfriend.” Bai Ran said, “Okay.” Chen Chen said, “You have to do everything it takes to convince her and make her happy.” Bai Ran answered, “Okay.” Staring at Bai Ranran’s calm face, Chen Chen felt an inexplicable sense of frustration and uneasiness. Seeing the lack of hesitation on Bai Ran’s face as she signed the divorce agreement, Chen Chen regretted it. To Bai Ran, ever since she signed the divorce agreement, Chen Chen’s name had been erased from her memory. Even though she had loved him for more than ten years, once she gave up, she would never look back.",

His wolf was livid.\n“Why do you think we will help?” Kace asked while narrowing his black obsidian eyes, his wolf took control of him. He was the youngest among the three and the less temperamental among them.\nThe three of them were cursed by Selene because of their ferocious action to gain supreme power and authority.\nThe moon goddess didn’t bless them with a mate as a punishment of their atrocious way and forced them to involve in this deadly war with the demons.\n“You will turn us into a slave for those sickly creatures!?” Torak asked incredulously. “Aren’t you afraid that we will snap them into two?”\nThe guardian angel was so fragile and they as lycanthropes didn’t appreciate the weaknesses.\n“No, you will not.” Selene said patiently. “You will not be their slave nor hurt them, you will cherish them in every way possible.”\nJedrek laughed menacingly upon hearing this, they didn’t care about the resurrected of the beast, once they crossed their territory, with or without the guardian angel he would tear their body apart. “I will be the last person they will see, once I find them.” He was referring to both the guardian angel and the demon.\nBut, the next voice from Selene was laced with mirth when she spoke.\n“You will not hurt your mate.”",

For one, there were unusual circumstances surrounding her birth, for another, she is the only pack member to never shift into a wolf form. So now she doesn’t quite belong anywhere. Not quite human and not quite wolf.She thought she would be able to live her life how she wanted when she had turned eighteen. Go to college, make some friends, have some fun. But what is she to do when the dangerously sexy Alpha literally falls right into her lap?“I am not human, and I am not a wolf. I don’t belong anywhere...”“...we both know that no one is going to mate with me, and even if they did, they would just reject me anyway.”What is the sexy, brooding Alpha going to do? The elders are making him hold these ridiculous parties to search for a mate. He doesn’t want a mate, but he knows he needs a mate to finish the Alpha Circle. Without a mate, a Luna for the pack, his people would suffer. And what is he going to do when he stumbles across the girl that fate has chosen for him and he finds out she has no wolf?“This cannot be!” I roared. “There is no way that I can mate with a girl that does not even have a wolf. She will be too weak. She will be inferior. She will not be strong enough to be a Luna.”“I simply could not accept her as my mate. Not fully. It wasn’t safe for her. She would get herself killed. And she would bring my pack down with her.”When these two meet, sparks will surely fly. But will it be from passion, or their constant fighting? Neither of them wanted a mate. Neither of them wants the mate that fate chose for them. And neither of them can make that mate bond go away. What are they going to do now that they’re literally stuck with each other?",

Most likely, I will write so that he has a certain relationship with some female characters, then he will leave her in her own universe. Only a few will follow him in his journey. Also, a few men will also be in his group. THIS IS NOT A YAOI.If you enjoy my writing, please go read my other novel. [Journey of the Fate Destroying Emperor] Although the story is slow in the beginning, it is worth the wait for the later plots.",

They could create new worlds— in virtual reality, that was more beautiful and profound than the real world they lived in.Upon seeing how Humankind started discarding the world created by the gods and embracing the fake world created by humans, gods were enraged.Thus, gods transported the souls of all the VR game players into the game created by gods—called Gods' impact, which was unlike any VR game. It was too surreal with daily struggles, quests, systems, monsters, and… more deadly and cruel than the real world.However, they could use their real-life skills and talents in the game. The money they earned in the game was added to their real-life bank account. As they evolved in the game, their body also changed in real life. Furthermore, the players who died in the game also died in the real world.How will Zach, who just happened to try out the VR game for the first time, only to be transported into Gods’ impact, survive?«Everyone’s stats are limited. I will become limitless by cultivating infinite MP!» Zach announced nonchalantly when he realized he might be the strongest player in the game.Little did the gods know that they would regret messing with Zach, and his existence alone would become a threat to them.***Author: English is not my native language, but that shouldn’t matter.

She died exhausted after turning the tables against the organization’s agents… but was reborn, transmigrating into a book as its villainess! The villainess’s family is rich and powerful. Being the only daughter, her mother and brothers would pamper her out of control, and she was engaged to the male lead at birth. Yet, the body’s original owner messed up big-time despite being dealt the perfect hand. She harassed the female lead to win the male lead’s attention and affection until she eventually incensed the male lead. He threw her into the colosseum ring, where she was torn to pieces. Her family naturally went all out to avenge her and ended up suffering multiple casualties as they fell into desperate straits…On the other hand, when Shi Man reincarnated, she told the male lead that they should go their separate ways and pretend they never knew each other even if they met again. She even paid the female lead with emotional duress compensation and told her they had nothing to do with each other from then on. However, after parting ways with them and preparing to begin a new life, the male lead regretted his choice and started wooing her. The supporting male characters who were never interested in her also had a sudden change of heart, and even the female lead was now offering to be her follower! Staring at the mob flocking around Shi Man, the Shi family was furious. “She belongs to our family! Stay away!”",

Mostly gamers, but some other types of people too. Our MC, Eldrian, is naturally a gamer who could not wait but to try it.Quickly he and everyone else who bought the headsets found themselves in a world, not just a game. While realism is nice and all, the amount they were given was just too much...Players started taking emotional tolls from playing the game, and when the company made a shocking announcement. This was amplified.--------------------------AN:I started this(July2020) just about a year ago now(June2021) as a newbie writer, and am proud with what it has become.I will warn people that the game and real-world is truly integrated, as well that the story is slow.Things don't magically happen for the sake of the story, I always try to figure out what would happen if this was reality.

        "description": "WARNING: FL is scheming and evil.\nLike almost every dramatic romance novel, Lily Qin’s story began with an evil stepmother, a scheming stepsister, and a dumb ex-fiance. At twenty, she fell prey to their grand scheme and became the laughingstock of the country. In despair, she left.\nSeven years later, Lily Qin rose from the ashes.\nShe was labeled as an empress, an iron lady, a genius, and a prodigy. She was Miss Tycoon.\nNow, at twenty-seven, Lily Qin was an established businesswoman who was single-handedly controlling her multinational company abroad. She was beautiful, smart, and successful. Women envied her while men couldn’t help but worship her ethereal beauty.\nWith her devastating past, everyone had assumed that Lily would exact revenge on the people who had wronged her. Who would have guessed that behind that beaming smile of hers was a numb heart that aimed only to make more profit?\n“You got it wrong.” Lily elegantly propped her chin on the back of her hand. ”I am seeing you today because we have something in common. We’re both villains in somebody else’s eyes. And I think it’s time for us villains to get our own happy ending. Don’t you think so?“\n---\nZhuo Jingren’s love for Lily Qin was something that only he knew. Ever since they were children, he had his eyes on her. Yet, every time he had tried to confess, he would end up fainting from nervousness.\nSo when Lily Qin promised to marry him if he became richer than her, Zhou Jingren did not hesitate to leave the orphanage and work his way up just to become her man.\nWho would have thought that years later, when he was successful and feared by many, he would come back to an engaged Lily Qin?\nThen she mistook him for an escort after eating his tofu? Preposterous!\nThe worst thing was, she seemed to have forgotten everything about him. Hadn’t she promised to marry him the moment he became more prominent than her family? Now, after taking advantage of him, she dared to run away?\nThis woman was a liar!\nHe gritted his teeth as he watched her approach him. He was about to say something mean when she suddenly spoke. “Are you my new bodyguard?” She did not even wait for him to answer before tossing her car keys at him. “Drive. Let’s go wreak some havoc.”\nThus, the mafia’s big boss became Lily Qin’s bodyguard.\n---\n“So? What do you want as a compensation?” Zhuo Jingren asked her once again before laying down next to her. His elbow was resting on the ground and his palm was supporting his head as he looked at her intently.\nThe first thing that Lily noticed about Zhuo Jingren when he laid next to her was his exposed tanned chest. This made him look more casual… and hot. She didn’t even realize she was staring at the latter.\n“Why are you staring at me like that?” He smirked at her. “Do you want me to compensate you with my body?”\nLily immediately rolled her eyes at the latter. “Who wants your body? Hmp! I want money!”\n“Your mind is always thinking of money but your body actually betrays you. Am I right to say that I have a shameless wife?”\n“Hah! I am a strong and independent woman of the 21st century. I know what I want. But if you insist on giving your body, I will take it too!” Lily shamelessly said, taking off her stilettos. However, just when Lily was about to lie down beside Zhuo Jingren, he suddenly pulled her on top of him. With her body on top of his, their faces were really close and they could even feel each other’s breath.\n“What a shameless woman,” he noted, the smile on his face only deepened.",

Who knew— The first baby: Cold and stern, he’s a young little adult who acts as a judge! He steps forward to draw a bolt of lightning from the heavens to punish scumbags. The second baby: Agile, lively, and extremely smart. Every time he moves his mouth, he can accurately predict the future! The third baby: One with an even colder personality, with a single wave of his finger, he can hook out your soul and play with it! Ye Lulu never had a boyfriend in the modern world. Yet, who would have expected that the moment she changed into a different identity, she would have children, a husband, and in-laws — basically, the whole package? Initially, she says, “The three babies are so cute. They’re my biological children. I can have them! As for my husband… I’ll get a refund.” Unexpectedly, Ye Lulu gradually realizes that her husband is very handsome! He seems very mysterious and charming! She seems to have developed feelings for him. How wonderful! However, Ye Lulu holds onto her little protective mask tightly and constantly warns herself to be conservative, as people in the ancient times are comparatively not as open-minded. Unexpectedly, that husband of hers is not himself either. He was a Yin God from the divine throne in the heavens where there were no restrictions, and thus is even more casual. One day, her handsome and god-like husband presses her against the wall and lifts his hand to hold her chin. He says to her in a husky voice, “I think I like you…” He lowers his head and kisses her deeply! Ye Lulu: “???” Something is wrong here! Aren’t you guys from the ancient past? Why are you so unrestrained?",

Thank you.Athan, a 16-year-old boy, lived until he was killed for a stupid reason. ( stupid reason \u0026 more in the prologue:v )But it seems that fate had stored different things for him as after death, His soul transmigrated to another world inside a dead body of a boy with the same name and same facial features as him.He also found out that a mysterious black whirlpool seemed to be inside him and connected to his soul.After the short unfortunate first life, he starts living his second life with more suffering that he chooses himself to get stronger but with that also comes happiness he had never experienced.A smooth sailing second life of Athan starts with something mystical inside his body and other benefits of it that could make him stronger with some suffering. However...he didn't know that due to his soul ( That was supposed to return to the source of the universe after death but instead, it transmigrated by someone for some purpose and that caused an adverse effect like increasing misfortune on his soul ) The benefits he receives ultimately becomes the source of his second doom that is even worse than death. But...that's when the future Void emperor is born.-------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted an MC that becomes stronger and reigns supreme without relying on anything external and he achieves his own unique power by virtue of his own hard work and ability. Although he gets benefits in the early stage of the story, That is the build-up for when he walks on the path he creates for himself.As you read more, it will get better so don't give up after just the first few chapters, At least please read the 2nd volume as The Real adventure starts in Volume 2[ Bloody Universe.] That's why my 103 chapters are free. [note: The First R-18 Chapter is 41. ]This is my first novel so expect some mistakes but I am striving to improve constantly because writing the story I play in my mind is so much fun and it's even more fun when people read it and enjoy it.",

        "description": "“Hurry to the hospital and donate your blood.” “Go to the hospital at once.” “Remember to donate blood at the hospital.” Even if she had already been donating blood for three times in the past few months, which then took a toll on her body, Huo Chuan never felt an ounce of pity for his so-called wife. After three years of marriage, Huo Chuan would only ever contact her to ask her to donate her blood to the hospital. No, accurately speaking, she was selling her blood. Selling it to Huo Chuan’s beloved woman, Bai Ting.\nYun Qing had been working hard to play the role of a good wife and secretary, but Huo Chuan’s family thought nothing of her. They were enigmatic and petty toward her. Yun Qing even had to do all the cleaning and cooking alone at home. Her existence was so menial that one would even assume she was a maid. In the company, everyone underestimated her. Yun Qing had had enough so she said, “Let’s divorce.” Perhaps she still had hope, but her husband’s reaction completely disappointed her. “What are you throwing a tantrum for? Name your price. The doctor says that Bai Ting is in a critical condition!” Huo Chuan’s mother said, “A lowly secretary like you should be grateful that you married into our Huo family, so why are you making a fuss?” Huo Chuan stared down at her. “I know that you’ve donated more blood this month, but I’ve transferred you the compensation fee! I can tolerate you asking for more, but I won’t tolerate your tantrum!” Looking at Huo Chuan’s mesmerizing features, Yun Qing laughed at herself. He was indeed charming, but he had never ever shown her a pleasant expression. Enduring the pain in her heart, Yun Qing insisted on going through the divorce with Huo Chuan. “Don’t you regret this, Yun Qing!” “Huo Chuan, the only thing I regret is agreeing to this marriage with you three years ago. This marriage had me all battered and bruised. Enough is enough!” For Huo Chuan, she gave up her status and ignored her family’s advice. She pounced at Huo Chuan like a moth to flames, only to receive his indifference and lack of affection in return.\nAfter Yun Qing left the Huo family, she got into a luxurious car. Old Master Yun’s heart ached for his daughter. “Qingqing, you had a three-year agreement with me, that if he doesn’t love you, you will come home and inherit the company. Now, it’s time to uphold your promise.”",

        "description": "Amamiya Hiroto is unlucky. His life consisted of misfortune after misfortune, culminating in an unlucky death during an incident on a school boat trip, trying to save a girl he barely knew. After death, he met a god of reincarnation who requested that the hundred or so dead passengers—one of them being the girl he tried in vain to save—be reincarnated into another world. Yet a series of unfortunate events forced Hiroto to reincarnate with even less luck than before, starting with nothing but a tremendous amount of Mana. His second life, far worse than his first, came to a cruel end. However, upon meeting the god a second time, he was informed that there would be yet another reincarnation—one that had already been set in motion and could not be stopped. Not wanting Hiroto to live long, the god cursed him before he was reborn in the hopes that he would either die quickly or commit suicide. Hiroto was reborn once more as a half-Vampire, half-Dark Elf. A Dhampir. Not wanting a fourth life, he is determined to live this third life with the only things remaining from his previous lives—death-attribute magic and his enormous Mana pool.",

        "description": "# HUSBAND-CHASING\nSi Mi had been foolish in her past life. She aborted the child she had with her husband just so she could return to her first boyfriend, Fu Xing. Yet, Fu Xing had no intention of reconciling with her, and even ridiculed her for flattering herself. With that, Si Mi felt that she had been abandoned by the world. She wandered the streets dejectedly and was killed by a car that malfunctioned. As her soul floated in midair, she saw her stepsister secretly meeting up with the driver who killed her to give him a large sum of hush money. She even saw her stepmother, who had always doted on her, say, “That girl finally died. At least my efforts weren’t wasted in spoiling her to the point of being brainless and arrogant! My dear daughter, you can finally relax and be with Fu Xing now.” Finally, Si Mi saw her ex-husband attending her funeral, and then took revenge for her death. Her supposedly disfigured husband even removed his mask for the first time before her portrait. The man’s flawless appearance seemed to be a gift from the gods. Every inch of him was meticulously perfect, and he wasn’t as hideous as the rumors painted him to be.\nThen, Si Mi lost all senses. When she opened her eyes, she found herself lying on a bed naked while a man rammed into her from above. It was her husband, Fu Zhen! She had just attended her own funeral moments ago as a wandering soul, so why was she in Fu Zhen’s bed now and making love to him? It seems that Si Mi was reborn back to the time when she had just married her husband. During this time, she had yet to abort Fu Zhen’s child, and hadn’t yet fallen into her stepmother and stepsister’s scheme! What perplexed Si Mi even more was that she now possessed the power of telekinesis after being reborn. Splendid! She swore not to be toyed with anymore in this life. She would also take revenge! More importantly… she had to compensate Fu Zhen for what she owed him. She would give her best to this man who once loved her deeply.",

As the vast oceans turn to dust and the thunder and lightning fade away, That strand of spiritual mist once again approaches our great world. With the shackles that bound our world now severed— A whole new world of mystery and wonder awaits, As we turn the corner... —— The Sacred Ruins is a story set in a post-apocalyptic world. A world that has recovered to a state that is roughly equal to our own world in terms of technology and culture, although its ancient history remains largely unknown. The story begins during the post-graduation trip of our protagonist, where he discovers some ancient ruins and witnesses “the great change”, an upheaval that changed everything. The changing earth not only brought about new, unexplored landscape but also sparked the evolution of all organisms. Plants and animals started gaining sentience and some humans obtained unimaginable powers. The legends, myths, and tales of old seemed to have suddenly come to life as the earth entered a new era where beasts and men formed factions, explored new lands and ultimately struggled for supremacy. We follow the MC as he grows from being an eccentric young man into a badass expert warrior while meeting other funny characters and forming brotherly bonds. We watch as he falls into just as much hilarious situations as he does perilous ones, all the while wondering and slowly discovering the mysteries of this world. Just why was the world destroyed in the first place? Who or what had triggered this earth-shattering “change”? What profundities lie behind the process of evolution?",

She needed it to save people, and he wanted to use it to save his own life.\n“Let go of it, or you will die.” The man’s violet eyes were cold and sinister as he said in a low voice.\nShe held on tightly to the base of the herb and pulled its roots right out of the ground, before she turned her eyes back with a crafty smile. “It’s mine now. Snatch it from me if you can.”\nWhen they met several years later they were no longer on opposing sides in hostility.

Overwhelm by desperation, Aries begged him to take her in. It was too late when she realized that the man she asked for help was far more cruel, twisted, and downright diabolical than the crown prince for taking her as his… pet!EXCERPT:With a pair of crimson eyes hovering over her, Aries held her breath. When the corner of his lips curled up devilishly, she couldn’t react fast as he swiftly flipped their position. She only realized it when she was saddling him, gazing down at Abel, wide-eyed.“No one is above me in this empire and even out — not even the law, but look at you,” he intoned with a devilish smirk. “Staring down on me… so daunting.”Aries bit her lip, planting her palm on her inked chest. “Your Majesty…”“Do you now understand the power you hold, darling?” Abel carefully wrapped his fingers around her wrist, chuffed by her reaction. “Only you, Aries, may go above me and the only person in this world who can look down on me. No one else.”He raised an arm and ran his fingers through the side of her hair, settling his palm on the back of her head before he pulled her down until her face was a palm length away from him.“You better use this at your own disposal,” he whispered, tilting his head as he lifted it up to claim what’s his.

As long as I am able to obtain victory, I don’t care if it’s total football or counterattack. What is the ultimate goal of professional soccer? In my opinion, it is victory, and the pinnacle of victory is to become the champions. I am a manager. If I don’t wish to lose my job or be forgotten by the people, there’s only one path for me to take, and that is to lead the team in obtaining victories, in obtaining championship titles!”\nThe main character was not well-liked by people.\n— “⋯We conducted a survey which had been deemed by Manager Tony Twain as extremely meaningless. In a random street survey conducted, ninety-three percent of those surveyed chose the option ‘I hate Tony Twain’, while only seven percent chose the option ‘This person is rather decent, I like him’. It is worth noting that nobody chose the option ‘Who is Tony Twain? I don’t know him’. Mark, do you know why Manager Twain felt that our survey was very meaningless?” Parker, a reporter from laughed loudly and said when he was being interviewed by BBC.\nBut there were also people who were madly in love with him.\n— When Tony Twain was forced to talk about the survey conducted by during an interview, his reply was : “I am happy, because Nottingham Forest’s fans make up seven percent of England’s population.”\nAnd he did not seem to care about how the others saw him.\n— “What are you all trying to make me say? Admit that I am not popular, and everywhere I go will be filled with jeers and middle fingers. You all think I will be afraid? Wrong! Because I am able to bring victory to my team and its supporters. I don’t care how many people hate me and can’t wait to kill me, and I also won’t change myself to accommodate the mood of these losers. You want to improve your mood? Very simple, come and defeat me.”\nHis love story had garnered widespread attention.\n— “Our reporters took these pictures at Manager Tony Twain’s doorsteps. It clearly shows that Shania entered his house at 8.34pm and she did not leave the house throughout the night at all. But Manager Tony Twain firmly denies, and insists that that was merely the newest-model inflatable doll which he had ordered.\nHe was the number one star of the team.\n— “⋯ Became the spokesperson of world-wide famous clothing brands, shot advertisements, frequented the fashion industry’s award ceremonies, endorsed electronic games, has a supermodel girlfriend. His earnings from advertisements exceed his club salary by seventeen times, owns a special column in various print medias, publishing his autobiography (in progress), and is even said that he is planning to shoot an inspirational film based off his own person experiences! Who can tell me which part of his life experiences is worthy of being called ‘inspirational’? Hold on⋯. Are you all thinking that I’m referring to David Beckham? You’re sorely mistaken! I’m talking about Manager Tony Twain⋯.”\nHe was very knowledgeable about Chinese soccer.\n— “⋯ I’ve heard about it, that Bora gifted four books to his manager Mr. Zhu before your country’s national team’s warm up match. After which, the team lost 1:3 to a nameless American team from Major League Soccer. The new excuse that Mr. Zhu gave for losing the match, was that Bora gifted “books” (‘books’ and ‘lose’ are homophones in the Chinese language). Here, I recommend that you guys find out what that one specific book is. Which book? Of course the one that caused you all to score a goal. After that, tell me the title of the book. Before every match, I will gift ten copies of that same book to you. In that case, won’t you all be able to get a triumphant 10:0 win over your opponents every time?” An excerpt taken from Tony Twain’s special column in a certain famous Chinese sports newspaper.\nHe was loved and hated by the press.\n— “He has a special column in at least four renowned print media, and he is able to get a considerable amount of remuneration just by scolding people or writing a few hundred words of nonsense weekly. While we have to contemplate hard about our drafts for three days before our boss is pleased with it. In an article inside his special column, he scolded and called all of the media ‘son of a bitch’, announcing that he hated the media the most. But every time he publishes an article, we flock towards him like flies which had spotted butter. Why? Because the readers like to read his news and see him scold people. I dare to bet with you, and Manager Tony Twain knows clearly in his heart as well, that even though he says that he hates us, he knows that the present him cannot do without us. Similarly, we also cannot do without him. Is this ultimately considered a good or a bad thing?” Bruce Pearce, a reporter from said with a face of helplessness when talking about Tony Twain.\nBut no matter the case, his players were his most loyal believers.\n— Gareth Bale, “No no, we never had any pressure when playing on our home grounds. Because the pressure is all on the manager. As long as we see him standing by the side of the field, all of us will feel that we will be able to win that match. Even the football hooligans are like meek lambs in front of him!” (After saying this, he began to laugh out loudly)\nThe reply from George Wood, the team captain of Nottingham Forest, was the most straightforward. “We follow him because he can bring us victory.”\nThe legendary experience of Tony Twain, the richest, most successful, most controversial manager with the most unique personality!\nDebuting this summer.\nThank you for reading.",

Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!",
