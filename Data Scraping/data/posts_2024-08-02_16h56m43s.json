They were crispy on the outside and super tender in the middle. They had really good flavor too even though I had no coriander nor cilantro. A couple things I'd do different next time, and recommend to others: 1) Careful not to chop/puree the chickpea mixture too much. I over-did it and they were a bit too runny. Stop when the mixture is still a bit course. 2) When deep-frying I found they did best at 350 degrees for 5 minutes (though I found another recipe telling me 375, I thought they came out too dark at that temp). 3) Sprinkle with course salt immediately after removing from the frier, the salt will stick better when they are still hot.\nSee More  ",

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was so good I'm making more for dipping veggies for our Fourth of July party this weekend! I did use an English cucumber because of its mild flavor (I don't like cucumbers) but I changed NOTHING in this recipe because it was perfect!

It's hearty, warming, and inviting, and has a greatly satisfying texture and consistency. Last night, I'd added some diced red & green bell peppers and finely chopped baby spinach. If sodium isn't an issue for someone, a bouillon cube adds a flavor boost, as does 1/2 tsp. of crushed Italian seasoning. It's tasty with Middle Eastern spices added or great with curry powder or curry paste added for a more exotic faux Mulligatawny variation. Your favorite salsa, picante sauce, a small can of green chilies, or Southwest-style diced tomatoes can change it up easily for a different twist on it, with a handful of crushed tortilla chips or even a few Fritos also tossed into it. Wonderful way to use up any leftover roasted or rotisserie chicken too. Beans, lentils, and peas work great in it also, and when I'm feeling particularly decadent, I quarter 2 hotdog-sized Polska kielbasa sausage links length-wise, and then dice the quarters into small pieces, to give it a hint of rich sausage flavor. Diced leftover Italian sausage or meatballs work well in it, also. It's hard to go wrong with this soup, since the recipe is both so good and also extremely versatile, so it can be made often and enjoyed in a variety of ways.\nSee More  ",

I just prepared one cup of dry organic Quinoa per the packaging instructions and proceeded as stated. I kept all of the veggies and other ingredients the same as I think Quinoa poofs up a bit more than the bulgar wheat. Plus I like lots of stuff in my salad. I eased up by just a bit on the olive oil and red wind vinegar but I don't think the whole amount would make much difference. Also, I used about 4 parts parsley to 1-2 parts mint which I got from my garden and is stronger than the stuff you buy in the store. I probably had at least a full 3/4 cup of parsley when chopped. To me, it is hard to determine how much \"one bunch\" is, so that's how I handled it. GREAT, GREAT recipe. Seriously the best Tabouleh Salad I have ever made.\nSee More  ",

        "content": "Tabbouleh has always been something I wanted to make, and this recipe is the one I will use every time! I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa and I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely and took other's advice and measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My \"1 bunch\" of green onions was 6 onions, and I used the whole onion-- both the green and the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, and it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well and only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, and kept the olive oil and red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture and flavor immensely, and about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad. I served this wonderful dish with hummus, pita bread, kalamata olives, and marinated Greek chicken kabobs (recipe was from a different website). Everyone loved it all!!

Next time I would use a bit less garlic but thats just personal prefernce I guess. I reduced the oil a tad cause I like it when my hummus is a bit sturdier instead of super creamy. Its amazing how versatile this recipe is because of the various topping options. This time I used olives and cayenne pepper on top.

I imagine cutting the oil back would be equally good, but as is was nice and rich and I liked that the vinegar didn't overpower the dressing.

Well, she stopped eating them...for whatever reason and didn't tell me, so I had a freezer full of beans. If the recipe turned out the way I was hoping it would, I would use it for our rehersal dinner for when my second DD gets married. We loved it! The salad had the crunch from the beans, sweetness from the tomatoes and salt from the cheese and olives!! I am not a big fan of oil floating around my foods (in fact, it turns me off totally!!) so I did make some changes. I had made a garlic infused oil (for another recipe) and had some of the oil and cooked garlic left over. I used some of the sun-dried tomato oil and the garlic infused oil and the left over garlic chips. I probably did not use even 1 T. It passed the \"bride has to try everything and see everything\" test and loved it!!! I dehydrate roma tomatoes when they come on sale... so next time, I will use half of my tomatoes and half of the oil infused tomatoes to use them up. If anybody else buys edamame at Costco, 3 cotainers equals just shy 2 cups. I have company coming in the next 2 weeks, so I think this recipe will get a good workout from me!

The only changes made were: I snipped the sun-dried tomatoes into small bits and by the time I had added about 2/3 cup of them to the edamame it looked like more would overwhelm the salad, so I didn't triple the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, but sliced and added about a pound of fresh ripe cherry tomatoes, instead. I couldn't find feta cheese, so substituted goat cheese (I read that it's a healthier cheese, anyway, with less fat and less salt). For the dressing (step 2), I decided I would like my garlic pureed, so I mixed the dressing in the blender. I feel like I have too many vinegars already on hand, so used red wine vinegar instead of buying white. I couldn't find white balsamic vinegar, so substituted what I found, which was golden balsamic vinegar. I also had forgotten to buy fresh oregano, so substituted 1/3 as much dried oregano, and I used extra-virgin olive oil. I mixed the edamame, tomatoes, onions and olives, then added the dressing. I found I needed only half of the dressing, so have kept the rest of the dressing aside, in a container in the fridge. Next time I will reduce those ingredients by half. This helps make the recipe lower in fat, too. The cheese was added just before serving. On re-visiting the left-overs the day after, I have found that even if certain ingredients are left out, it still is terrific! My husband picks out the onion and I pick out the olives, but it's delicious even without those. Some of the salad was left without cheese because there were vegans at the potluck -- and it tastes delicious without the cheese, as well.\nSee More  ",

The contrast of textures, colours, made it truly wonderful. Thanks again for sending the za'atar, I'll have to work on the substitute now because this is a definite make again. I too forgot the parsley, but it was still so flavoursome without. Next time I will add more artichokes as I accidentally bought too small a jar!\nSee More  ",

I served this with Chicken ala Turk, recipe 74351, and used this as a side salad. I think the ingredients could easily be adjusted to taste among the artichokes, peppers, chickpeas, and avocado. Roasted chicken would also be an interesting addition to this, I think, to make this a main dish salad. You might just need to add a little bit more dressing. I realized after the dinner was over that I had forgotten to add the parsley to this, and that would have added yet another dimension of flavor to an already fantastic salad, although it tasted great as it was. I am definitely going to be making this again! Thanks, SG!\nSee More  ",

Also, we only had about 2/3 c. feta cheese left, so we put all of that in. I'm actually glad that's all we used because I think I would have found the feta flavor overpowering had we used the specified amount. Lastly, rather than roasting the red pepper and using it for garnish, I roasted it and just threw it into the food processor with the rest of the ingredients. Next time, I might cut back on the hot sauce. I like the heat it imparts, but the flavor is too prominent. I also think that I will throw the kalamata olives in with the rest of it next time, rather than using them for garnish.\nSee More  ",
