They were crispy on the outside and super tender in the middle. They had really good flavor too even though I had no coriander nor cilantro. A couple things I''d do different next time, and recommend to others: 1) Careful not to chop/puree the chickpea mixture too much. I over-did it and they were a bit too runny. Stop when the mixture is still a bit course. 2) When deep-frying I found they did best at 350 degrees for 5 minutes (though I found another recipe telling me 375, I thought they came out too dark at that temp). 3) Sprinkle with course salt immediately after removing from the frier, the salt will stick better when they are still hot.

I used mint AND fresh basil. I cut out 1 tablespoon each of the oil and lemon juice and it was just right. I brought the lentils to a boil and then turned them down to a very low simmer for 25 minutes. They were almost a little too soft but most of them held their shape really well. I poured ice water over them to stop the cooking process. Good recipe and good for you, too.

I prepared the dressing separately and only added what I needed which was probably about half. It needs lots of freshly ground black pepper. I used green lentils and it was so nice even though I only had about 4oz of feta. I made mine at the start of the week and it kept well in the fridge for a couple of days. One lot of left-overs I added some cherry tomatoes and on another portion I added some diced fresh beetroot (OMG that made it even better). Dont omit the mint as it makes this salad. It was lovely to eat something that tasted so sinful yet it really good for you!!!!!!! Thanks Mindy xxx

It takes a little longer, but it will keep them from turning into dal. Also, french lentils are smaller and fatter than other lentils (ie: most lentils you find in the supermarket). French lentils are used when you want to keep them whole for salads and such. I have done the low heat on regular lentils, and it works for me. Also, salting your water before you bring the lentils to a boil can help them keep their shape.

I really like the flavor of the mint. This time, I found there was too much dressing (I think this may be in part because I didn''t use the full amount of cheese), so if your measurements are a bit loose, it might be a good idea to whisk those ingredients together and then add as needed. I''ve successfully used balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice; it''s a different flavor, but still very tasty.

We found them bland, which surprised me given the delectable spices that went into them, and dry. Now a friend of mine who has had Falafel in Israel liked them though she agreed they were a bit dry and suggested adding a small amount of extra virgin olive oil to the mix. I may try this again adding oil and doubling the spices, if I do I''ll update my review.

They were crispy on the outside and super tender in the middle. They had really good flavor too even though I had no coriander nor cilantro. A couple things I''d do different next time, and recommend to others: 1) Careful not to chop/puree the chickpea mixture too much. I over-did it and they were a bit too runny. Stop when the mixture is still a bit course. 2) When deep-frying I found they did best at 350 degrees for 5 minutes (though I found another recipe telling me 375, I thought they came out too dark at that temp). 3) Sprinkle with course salt immediately after removing from the frier, the salt will stick better when they are still hot.
