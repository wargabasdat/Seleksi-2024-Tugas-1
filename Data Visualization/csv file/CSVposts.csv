5,293197,498487,"No stars because I really didn't know what to expect from this recipe. I've never had Falafel before and just thought this would be a nice change of pace. It didn't go over as well as I'd hoped. We found them bland, which surprised me given the delectable spices that went into them, and dry. Now a friend of mine who has had Falafel in Israel liked them though she agreed they were a bit dry and suggested adding a small amount of extra virgin olive oil to the mix. I may try this again adding oil and doubling the spices, if I do I'll update my review.",1,review
6,293197,1580637,"First time making (though long time eating!) falafel and this was surprisingly easy and really really good (I used all dried garbanzos though). They were crispy on the outside and super tender in the middle. They had really good flavor too even though I had no coriander nor cilantro. A couple things I'd do different next time, and recommend to others: 1) Careful not to chop/puree the chickpea mixture too much. I over-did it and they were a bit too runny. Stop when the mixture is still a bit course. 2) When deep-frying I found they did best at 350 degrees for 5 minutes (though I found another recipe telling me 375, I thought they came out too dark at that temp). 3) Sprinkle with course salt immediately after removing from the frier, the salt will stick better when they are still hot.",0,review

I really like the flavor of the mint. This time, I found there was too much dressing (I think this may be in part because I didn't use the full amount of cheese), so if your measurements are a bit loose, it might be a good idea to whisk those ingredients together and then add as needed.

It's hearty, warming, and inviting, and has a greatly satisfying texture and consistency. Last night, I'd added some diced red & green bell peppers and finely chopped baby spinach. If sodium isn't an issue for someone, a bouillon cube adds a flavor boost, as does 1/2 tsp. of crushed Italian seasoning. It's tasty with Middle Eastern spices added or great with curry powder or curry paste added for a more exotic faux Mulligatawny variation. Your favorite salsa, picante sauce, a small can of green chilies, or Southwest-style diced tomatoes can change it up easily for a different twist on it, with a handful of crushed tortilla chips or even a few Fritos also tossed into it. Wonderful way to use up any leftover roasted or rotisserie chicken too. Beans, lentils, and peas work great in it also, and when I'm feeling particularly decadent, I quarter 2 hotdog-sized Polska kielbasa sausage links length-wise, and then dice the quarters into small pieces, to give it a hint of rich sausage flavor. Diced leftover Italian sausage or meatballs work well in it, also.

I kept all of the veggies and other ingredients the same as I think Quinoa poofs up a bit more than the bulgar wheat. Plus I like lots of stuff in my salad. I eased up by just a bit on the olive oil and red wind vinegar but I don't think the whole amount would make much difference. Also, I used about 4 parts parsley to 1-2 parts mint which I got from my garden and is stronger than the stuff you buy in the store. I probably had at least a full 3/4 cup of parsley when chopped.

9,379639,7578910,"Tabbouleh has always been something I wanted to make, and this recipe is the one I will use every time! I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa and I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely and took other's advice and measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My ""1 bunch"" of green onions was 6 onions, and I used the whole onion-- both the green and the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, and it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well and only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, and kept the olive oil and red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture and flavor immensely, and about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad.

Also, I grilled the fish on the BBQ instead of cooking it on the stovetop. That is the beauty of this recipe--because the salsa goes on top of the fish after it is cooked, you really can prepare the fish any way you like. I highly recommend grilling it. The salsa had excellent flavor. This is definitely a recipe that I will be making again. Made for ZWT4.",0,tweak

3,8892,486725,"I did alter this a bit, but we loved it that way. I looked at the other reviews and decided to add oil and lemon. I also barely wilted the spinach (and added much less, because of it), used more fresh dill and capers, and added potatoes, to make a meal out of it. The capers, dill, potatoes and feta went so well together in this. As another reviewer mentioned, it makes a delicious base to potentially add things to (like beans, potatoes, etc.).",1,review
4,8892,470351,"Very tasty spinach dish! I loved the combo of flavors and was surprised at someone's comment that the dill made it awful. I used fresh dill and barely noticed it in this dish. I sauteed the onions, garlic and dill with a bit of olive oil...then also tossed in the tomatoes for a minute before removing all from heat. I loved the low fat method of cooking the spinach with water. I tried it and loved it. The pairing of capers and feta with this was also really great. I will definitely make this one again.",1,review

I sauteed the onions garlic and dill in some oil. Used Campanari (cherry) tomatoes because those are the only ones I find have any real flavor here in this City. After the onions and garlic were done sauteing I threw the tomatoes in for about 30 seconds. Sauteed the spinach in a little olive oil and not water. I really found this a delicious quick salad to put together. Didn't come anywhere near 25 minutes to cook though. And so colorful when put together. Thanks so much for posting Mary. Loved it.",1,review

I did make a couple of minor changes, I used a large can of spinach instead of fresh and used cherry tomatoes (they are the only ones with flavor now) which I stirred into the spinach mixture just before removing from the heat. The dill gave it a hit of tartness similar to the splash of vinegar we normally add to spinach. Thanks so much for a new favorite!",0,tweak

Very tasty. I had it with some leftover swordfish that I flaked and stirred throughout. This would also be nice over rice or pasta, or with some canned garbanzo or white beans thrown in. The feta was the perfect touch. Would also be nice with fresh shredded parmesan, pine nuts or some cumin. What a nice base! Thanks, Mary!

1,179813,333017,"My DD got into an Edamame kick a while ago, so I was buying them in packages at Costco. Well, she stopped eating them...for whatever reason and didn't tell me, so I had a freezer full of beans. If the recipe turned out the way I was hoping it would, I would use it for our rehersal dinner for when my second DD gets married. We loved it! The salad had the crunch from the beans, sweetness from the tomatoes and salt from the cheese and olives!! I am not a big fan of oil floating around my foods (in fact, it turns me off totally!!) so I did make some changes. I had made a garlic infused oil (for another recipe) and had some of the oil and cooked garlic left over. I used some of the sun-dried tomato oil and the garlic infused oil and the left over garlic chips. I probably did not use even 1 T. It passed the ""bride has to try everything and see everything"" test and loved it!!! I dehydrate roma tomatoes when they come on sale... so next time, I will use half of my tomatoes and half of the oil infused tomatoes to use them up. If anybody else buys edamame at Costco, 3 cotainers equals just shy 2 cups. I have company coming in the next 2 weeks, so I think this recipe will get a good workout from me! Thanks Chef!!",3,review
2,179813,269829,"I tried this recipe for a potluck and we loved it! (I tripled the recipe.) It is a very aromatic dish that scents the whole house. Mmm! The only changes made were: I snipped the sun-dried tomatoes into small bits and by the time I had added about 2/3 cup of them to the edamame it looked like more would overwhelm the salad, so I didn't triple the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, but sliced and added about a pound of fresh ripe cherry tomatoes, instead. I couldn't find feta cheese, so substituted goat cheese (I read that it's a healthier cheese, anyway, with less fat and less salt). For the dressing (step 2), I decided I would like my garlic pureed, so I mixed the dressing in the blender. I feel like I have too many vinegars already on hand, so used red wine vinegar instead of buying white. I couldn't find white balsamic vinegar, so substituted what I found, which was golden balsamic vinegar. I also had forgotten to buy fresh oregano, so substituted 1/3 as much dried oregano, and I used extra-virgin olive oil. I mixed the edamame, tomatoes, onions and olives, then added the dressing. I found I needed only half of the dressing, so have kept the rest of the dressing aside, in a container in the fridge. Next time I will reduce those ingredients by half. This helps make the recipe lower in fat, too. The cheese was added just before serving. On re-visiting the left-overs the day after, I have found that even if certain ingredients are left out, it still is terrific! My husband picks out the onion and I pick out the olives, but it's delicious even without those. Some of the salad was left without cheese because there were vegans at the potluck -- and it tastes delicious without the cheese, as well.",2,review

4,290384,546010,"This is amazing. The flavor is perfect. I didn't tweak it, whatsoever. That has got to be a first! This will be in our rotation of meatless EGGSiting dinner dishes. The timing was spot on as well. Just perfect.",0,review
5,290384,222478,"Tasty! Beautiful combination of flavours and it was much enjoyed as a light dinner. I thought the quantity of olive oil may have been a little too much at first but using a good quality one it really added to the dish and kept it all nice and moist.",0,review

2,304676,452355,"This was a great dinner. It was a little labor intensive, but well worth the end result and all the wonderful flavors. I used fresh herbs from my garden and kalamata olives. We did not modify this recipe a bit, nor would we recommend any changes. Thanks for a lovely meal and one that we will be making again.",0,review

5,304676,866232,"Very tasty, fresh, and high end-tasting. My wife said it may have been the best meal I ever made--and I have made many good ones. Thanks for sharing this impressive recipe. P.S. - Prep time for me was much longer than 20 minutes maybe because of all the gathering, washing and chopping--maybe 50-60 minutes total.",0,review

2,214004,900992,"This is delicious! We had to make some changes because we ran out of some things. We used 1/4 c. half-and-half instead of 1/2 c. milk because we discovered that our milk was bad when we got ready to measure it. Also, we only had about 2/3 c. feta cheese left, so we put all of that in. I'm actually glad that's all we used because I think I would have found the feta flavor overpowering had we used the specified amount. Lastly, rather than roasting the red pepper and using it for garnish, I roasted it and just threw it into the food processor with the rest of the ingredients. Next time, I might cut back on the hot sauce. I like the heat it imparts, but the flavor is too prominent. I also think that I will throw the kalamata olives in with the rest of it next time, rather than using them for garnish.",0,review
3,214004,220348,"This is a creamy and smooth dip that everyone should try! It is also very refreshing, and made me think of summer, so I'll try again, then. The hot sauce made the dip a bit tangy as opposed to hot, but I kind of liked it that way. Veey good with pita bread.",0,review
4,214004,880889,"This recipe is a keeper! I had grown tired of hummus over the summer and was looking for something a little different. This was it! It is not really hot/spicy with the hot sauce, but well seasoned and the flavors really blend well together. A snap to make. Served with pita chips and cucumbers. I used low fat feta and it did not seem to affect the outcome. You'll get raves with this one!",0,review
5,214004,239758,"Wonderful dip that has a nice little kick to it. I used a little less milk because I added the moist roasted red pepper to the main dip mix. Served at work for Friday night drinks with cucumber slices, celery sticks and bread.",0,review

1,70005,11176,"Without knowing how many tomatoes to use, I settled on 7 medium-sized beauties. The end result was a tad over-seasoned; I think about 10-11 tomatoes of this size would have been perfect for me. I baked them for 6 hours and they were still a little wet to the touch, so I put them in the dehydrator overnight on a low setting and they came out nice. I had them in a pasta and prosciutto with arugula pesto last night and we both had seconds. Oh, the aroma... ~*inhales deeply*~ YUM! :) Thanks for the lovely recipe!",2,review
2,70005,56181,"These were very easy to make and very tasty! It doesn't say how many tomatoes to use, but I used about 5. I also didn't have the fresh spices on hand so I used about 1 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp basil, and 1 tsp of oregano, put them together in a ziploc baggie and ran my rolling pin over it a few times to make the spices extra fine. Anyway, this was a great way to use up some extra tomatoes and I will definitely make again!",2,review

4,70005,1666717,"This was a vary easy recipe. I used three different types of cherry tomatoes (yellow pear, sun sugar, and red cherry) and a food dehydrator instead of the oven they took about 12 hours to dry. They turned out awesome and we ended up doing about 2 gallons of tomatoes.",1,review
5,70005,231057,"Another great review for a great recipe! I put all the ""cleaned"" tomato pieces in a big bowl and drizzled with the olive oil and seasonings, then laid them out on the foil lined cookie sheet (quicker for me). Loved the aroma in the house while these were baking and they are so good. Put the pieces in small baggies for the freezer for future use also. (This is an experiment on my part - I have never frozen sun dried tomatoes.) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",1,review
