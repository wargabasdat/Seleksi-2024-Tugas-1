obitouzumaki,01/14/2019,boruto: naruto next generations,2017,1,all they did was copy a bit of naruto like for example team seven's first c ranked mission in naruto turned into a b rank the did the same thing with boruto his first c rank mission turned into a b ranked one then at the chunnin exam there's an invasion in naruto the sound and sand villages invade in boruto two members of the ōtsutsuki clan invade my other problem is that they made naruto weak i'm sure everyone can agree the naruto is god tier since he has six paths chakra the whole nine tails and some of the chakra from the other tailed beast he's a toad sage and he's the reincarnation of asura so how is it that he gets captured so easily by the ōtsutsuki why did he get stabbed so easily by shin my third problem is boruto himself he just annoys me he's bratty and for some reason he's chunnin level we didn't we that growth no training honestly i would have preferred they continued naruto or just stopped there no sequel
