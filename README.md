## Topic and DBMS
Food is one of the most crucial things in daily life. For this reason, food is also one of the businesses that many people are involved in. Along with the times, many people are turning to healthier foods, one of which is Mediterranean diet foods. This field will be a pretty good prospect in the FNB field. So, in this database laboratory assistant selection task, I chose a topic about “Mediterranean Food Recipe” taken from the food.com web.  The data taken is data about food recipes, users, ingredients, and posts (questions, reviews, and tweaks). The database management system is used to manage the community website. <br>


## How to Run the Scrapper

Clone this repository with the command 
```shell
Git clone https://github.com/evelynnn04/Seleksi-2024-Tugas-1.git
```
Enter the src folder with the command 
```shell
cd Data Scraping/src
```
Run the scrapper with the command 
```shell
scrapper.py 
```
The output of the scrapper run is six json files that will be stored in the "Data Scraping/data" folder: <br>
- Ingredients_[timestamp].json <br>
- Madeof_[timestamp].json <br>
- Recipes_[timestamp].json <br>
- Reviews_[timestamp].json <br>
- Tweaksandquestions_[timestamp].json <br>
- Users_[timestamp].json <br>

To generate sql files, json files can be processed with the pandas library. The result of querying "insert into" is then merged with the "create table" template to generate a useful sql file. For template and converter code, feel free to contact me!

## Explanation of ERD and Relational Diagram in RDBMS 

### ERD
There are 5 entities:
- users: user_id, name, username, user_rating_avg, city, state, joined_year, joined_month, followers, following. <br>
- ingredients: ingredient_id, ingredient_name, season_start, season_end, calories, total_fat, saturated_fat, cholesterol, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, sugar, sodium. <br>
- recipes: food_id, food_name, serving_size, calories, total_fat, saturated_fat, cholesterol, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, sugar, sodium. <br>
- posts: post_id, content, likes, type. <br>
- reviews: rating. <br> <br>

Additional notes:
- The “reviews” entity is a disjoint result of the “posts” entity. <br>
- The “posts” entity is a weak entity of the “recipes” entity. <br> <br>

There are 4 relations:
- write: a relation between “users” and “recipes” entities where one user can write more than one recipe but each recipe only has one author (one to many). <br>
- posting: a relationship between the “posts” entity and “users” where one user can write more than one post but each post only has one author (one to many). <br>
- posted: a relationship between “recipes” and “posts” entities where each post can be uniquely identified by its recipe and there will be no post if there is no recipe. <br>
- madeof: a relationship between “recipes” and “ingredients” where each recipe can have more than one ingredient and each ingredient can be used in more than one recipe (many to many). <br> <br>

### Relational Diagram
There are 6 relations (tables):
- users: user_id (varchar 255), name (varchar 255), username (varchar 255), user_rating_avg (float), city (varchar 255), state (varchar 255), joined_year (integer), joined_month (integer), followers (integer), following (integer); with the primary key "user_id" and does not have foreign keys. <br>
- ingredient: ingredient_id (varchar 255), ingredient_name (varchar 255), beginning_season (varchar 255), end_season (varchar 255), calories (float), total_fat (float), saturated_fat (float), cholesterol (float), protein (float), carbohydrate (float), fiber (float), sugar (float), sodium (float); with primary key "ingredient_id" and no foreign keys. <br>
- recipe: food_id (varchar 255), maker id (varchar 255), food_name (varchar 255), portion size (float), calories (float), total_fat (float), saturated_fat (float), cholesterol (float), protein (float), carbohydrate (float), fiber (float), sugar (float), sodium (float); with primary key "food_id" and foreign key "maker id" referring to "users. user_id". <br>
- madeof: food_id (varchar 255), ingredient_id (varchar 255); with primary keys ("food_id", "ingredient_id") and foreign keys "food_id" referring to "recipes.food_id" and "ingredient_id" referring to "ingredients.ingredient_id". <br>
- posts: post_id (varchar 255), food_id (varchar 255), user_id (varchar 255), content (text), likes (float), type (varchar 255); with primary keys ("post_id", "food_id") and foreign keys "food_id" referring to "recipes.food_id" and "user_id" referring to "users.user_id". <br>
- reviews: post_id (varchar 255), food_id (varchar 255), rating (float); with primary key ("post_id", "food_id") and foreign keys "post_id", "food_id" referring to "posts.post_id" and "posts.food_id". <br> <br>


## How to Convert ERD into Relational Diagram
1. Transform a many to many relations into a new table which contain the primary keys of the two initial tables (for example in a “madeof” relation). <br>
2. For one to many relations, insert the primary key from table “one” into table “many” (for example in the write relation, the primary key of the users table is inserted into the attribute in the recipes table). <br><br>
